This guessing game is desinged as a social experiment to show the user how many people it takes to be in a room to have a 90% probability that two people have the same birthdate. <br> <br>
Rest assured, no math is required, just guessing will suffice. 

Update 5.12.15
We fixed two bugs - confirm with a negative answer, and allowed user input to accept strings and numbers. 
cleaned up spacing and tabs. Added necessary syntax. 
Future enhancement would be to add and broaden range for hot and cold. 
Question for class: adding a break in case user wants to leave program mid stream (ie. cancel)
